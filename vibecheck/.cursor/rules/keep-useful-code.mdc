# Keep Useful Code

When suggesting edits or refactoring:

1. **Preserve working code** — Don't remove or replace logic that already works unless explicitly asked.
2. **Minimal changes** — Apply only the changes requested; avoid unnecessary rewrites.
3. **Keep existing patterns** — Match the project's established style, naming, and structure.
4. **Don't break features** — Event suggestions, task suggestions, location suggestions, and other app features must continue to work after edits.
